# Anomaly-Detection-Code-Snippets
this includes code snippets for some algorithms that detect anomalies (outliers ) and remove them automatically based on Machine learning.
these models are trained and tested on well test data (ptroleum industry).
the algorithms included here : ISOLATIONFOREST, Minimum Covariance Determinant, LocalOutlierFactor, OneClassSVM.
