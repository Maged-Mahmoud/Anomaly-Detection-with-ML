# Anomaly-Detection-
this includes code for some algorithms that detect anomalies (outliers ) and remove them automatically based on Machine learning
these models are trained and tested on well test data (ptroleum industry)
the algorithms included here : ISOLATIONFOREST, Minimum Covariance Determinant, LocalOutlierFactor, OneClassSVM.
